# My Experience Taking The CompTIA ITF+ Certification and what comes next
In February of this year ( 2024 ) I took the CompTIA ITF+ exam. The entry level certification for enthusiasts and those interested in starting a field in Information Technology. Since I'm teaching myself to become a Penetration Tester through sites like hackthebox and TryHackMe, I thought taking a beginner friendly ceritifcation would be a good way to test my studying and test taking skills before diving into the more serious topics. 

It took me about a month of intense studying and I got about a 80% after passing the exam. I was able to locate a .pdf file online that was a bit outdated (which I found out later from the exam throwing questions at me that I had never seen before.) I don't recommend this personally, shell out the cash for a study guide.

### Using A Study Guide, and Studying Hacks
Using a study guide to understand the information was *really* helpful for my learning style. I was able to slowly go through each piece of information. I get a bit turned around if I don't understand something, so I like to have all of the information so I can paint a whole picture in my head of the concept I'm trying to understand. Reading the study guide, and taking notes by hand along the way was the key to success for me.

One topic that I initially felt like I didn't understand the full concept of, was Databases and their commands. So when I had trouble understanding a certain topic, I would set a timer for 30min, and start Googling. Allowing my own interests in the subject take the lead. Or answer any questions I had about the topic, i.e.; is *x* a relational database or a flat file. I did this to help my brain stay super engaged during the month I was studying and made sure I never felt too uninterested. Luckily I was constantly really engaged in the material and interested to know more.

In summary, I read every page of the study guide for the ITF+ by CompTIA and took notes on every section. This was the main source of knowledge for me.

### Reddit and Other Resources

On the CompTIA subreddit, there are a lot of people commenting on how they study for each certification, through this I was able to find websites that provide practice exams with questions similar to the ones on the real thing. Going through these in between each section of the study guide, and taking a few of them multiple times after I had completed the study guide was also really helpful. 

Something that was ** not helpful ** was the Udemy course that I took for the ITF+. I did this about halfway through the study guide to see what else was out there, and it gave not many specifics and left out a lot of information. There was no way I could've passed had I taken the exam using that course alone. I do not recommend it.

[Here is a Reddit post with tools to passing the ITF+](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15bn8fk/passing_the_itf_in_3_days_a_detailed_guide_to/) While this was very helpful to read (especially because I had sought out other resources about halfway in, after feeling the repetition of the Study Guide to be a bit mundane), I dont recommend doing exactly what this person did. You can find practice exams and apply a more fast paced approach to learning and test taking through this resource.

Something that was really important to me was to not *just* pass the ITF+, but to wield a whole new trove of information that would help me get started in a new field. And that is exactly what the study guide, and taking thorough notes helped me accomplish. If I was in a pinch and wanted to just pass a test, I couldve done it in a week and then forgotten everything after I had taken it. But my interests in the subject continue to grow still after retaining the information on the exam's subjects- Computer Hardware, IoT, Programming, Databases, Networks, Security, and the not as fun but still intriguing topics of Setting up a Windows Machine. Because in order to protect something you need to undestand how it works from the ground up.

### Taking The Exam

Taking the exam was a fairly straight forward experience, I signed up on the no so straight forward CompTIA website and scheduled my time for that day, and took the exam. There were questions that I had never seen before, again my suspicion is I was studying on an outdated Study Guide. Aside from that, it felt just like the practice exams except a bit harder. I wasn't entirely sure if I had passed to be quite honest but turns out I did pretty well.

## What Comes Next

After getting my ITF+ Certification, I have developed strong interests in networking, programming and security. I'm continuing my journey forward to learning Cybersecurity and head down the road to eventually Pentesting or a smiliar role of this category in Red Team. I will take more courses, and aim for the OSCP certification eventually. I will be spending the next few months doing as many modules and machines on Try Hack Me's website, until I feel ready to apply for entry level Cybersecurity adjascent roles, such as junior networking or infrastrcuture type positions. I know for me, being hands on and in the field is the best way to reinforce but also learn what it is I need to know.

### Hack The Box Academy: Intro To Networking

I read through, and again took thorough notes, on HackTheBox Academy's Intro to Networking module. The ITF+ set me up so I had a great foundation for what I was learning. I already saw many familiar terms either from the study guide or when I would do a deeper search because I wanted to know more about a topic on the study guide. 

### Projects

The purpose of these projects is because I want to know more on a certain subject I am interested in so engaging in project style learning helps me to develop a better understanding. I have multiple projects written down, **this blog** being one of them. I won't go too into detail as I will do so in later posts, but here are a few:
-**Programming** project using C to create a simple networking application. Most likely simple instant messaging program using terminal.
  -Using ChatGPT to help structure building blocks and pseudocode. As a gateway to learning network programming then doing my own research for further understanding topics. Again most likely taking thorough notes.
  
-**Remote Server** - configure old Dell Optiplex 7020 with upgraded NIC and RAM, into a *Minecraft* server that works as cross platform and runs Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine (most likely **Virtual Box**). Using **OpenSSH** to install the server files for Minecraft.
  - At the time of writing I have started this project and am using Guacomole, hosted on Cloudflare and running on Linode to be able to log into a computer at m(y parents home that I built and left there) via SSH.
-Creating a blog for unanswered questions, being hosted on Github.

other ideas, not entirely sure if I'll have the time as I want to spend a lot of time on Try Hack Me at this point:
-Build a router using used computer found on Facebook marketplace
-Make a VPN

**Thank you for taking the time to read this far, I always encourage anyone to reach out if there was anything you'd like me to expand upon, or if any of this at all was helpful (which is the main point to all of this) please let me know-- I'm always available to chat**
