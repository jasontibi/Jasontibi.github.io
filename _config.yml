description: "<b>A Cybersecurity Student's Guide to Unanswered Questions:</b> From studying Cybersecurity to developing projects on my own, I have many unanswered questions that develop while I'm trying to understand different topics on the vast subject. A few but not limited to, topics you'll find: IT, Homeservers, Protecting PII, Ethical Hacking, Cybersecurity Certificaion Training, Exploits, Vulnerbilities, Programming, Networking, Scripting, Madonna, Linux, pfSense, etc.. I'm using this platform to dedicate time to write about the questions I come across and attempt to answer them through my <i>own</i> research online, and other materials. I'm truly fascinated by <b>all</b> things Cybersecurity, IT, and Computers. In addition, I'll post projects, creative outlets, and occasionally I'll write about myself.
