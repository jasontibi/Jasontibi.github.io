 # My CompTIA ITF+ Certification Journey and What's Next
 ### ITF+
In February 2024, I embarked on the CompTIA ITF+ exam journey, seeking an entry-level certification to validate my growing interest in Information Technology. 
As someone self-teaching to become a Penetration Tester through platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, 
I viewed this certification as a solid foundation for more advanced topics.

### Study Guide and Other Resources
After a month of intensive study, relying primarily on a study guide, I achieved an 80% score on the exam.
Utilizing the study guide allowed me to grasp concepts thoroughly, and I supplemented my learning by setting 
aside time to explore topics I found challenging, such as databases and their commands. I highly recommend using the [CompTIA ITF+ Study Guide](https://www.comptia.org/training/books/it-fundamentals-fc0-u61-study-guide), and taking thorough notes as a method of preperation.
This will give you not only a complete understanding of the material, but a full proof way of passing the test. It's worth every cent.

In addition to the study guide, I found valuable resources on the CompTIA [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15bn8fk/passing_the_itf_in_3_days_a_detailed_guide_to/), discovering practice exams that closely mirrored the real test. 
However, I caution against relying solely on certain online courses (UDEMY ITF+), as they may lack comprehensive coverage of exam topics. Take notice of **testprep**, found in the subreddit link, repetivive test taking was a crucial part to my understanding of the material.

### Exam Day
Taking the exam itself was a straightforward process, although encountering unfamiliar questions hinted at the possibility of studying from an outdated source. Nonetheless, I performed well and successfully obtained the ITF+ certification.

### What Comes Next
Looking ahead, my newfound interest in networking, programming, and security motivates me to pursue further certifications, notably the OSCP. To bolster my skills, I plan to immerse myself in practical exercises, such as those offered by TryHackMe, while also delving into projects like setting up a Minecraft server and exploring network programming with C.

These projects serve as hands-on learning opportunities, reinforcing my understanding of key concepts. As I continue this journey, I remain open to new challenges and eager to expand my knowledge in the cybersecurity field.
