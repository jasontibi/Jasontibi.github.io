<b>A Cybersecurity Student's Guide to Unanswered Questions:</b> From studying Cybersecurity to developing projects on my own, I have many unanswered questions that develop while I'm trying to understand different topics in Cybersecurity and IT as a whole. A few but not limited to, topics you'll find: <em> Homeservers, DIY Projects, Ethical Hacking, Cybersecurity Certificaion Training, Exploits, Vulnerbilities, Programming, Networking, Scripting, Linux, pfSense, etc..</em> I'm using this platform to dedicate time to write about the questions I come across while studying Cybersecurity and attempt to answer them through my <i>own</i> research online, and other materials. I'm fascinated by all things Cybersecurity, IT, and Computers but I'll also post projects and creative things I'm working on as well.
